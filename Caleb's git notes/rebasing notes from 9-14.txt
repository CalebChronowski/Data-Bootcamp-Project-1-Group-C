Masters and branches
	-The master represents the complete version with every merged branch that has been committed. Each number is a new version.
	
	-Branches can be made off the master. They are copies on the repository. If you commit a local branch to the repository, it's on the 			branch, but it is not on the master branch. This happens when you merge the branch to master.

	-If someone merges a branch before you're ready to merge your branch, then the updated version is named after a letter.
	
	-When you merge and there are parity issues, the most recent merger gets to decide whose code stays and whose code gets overwritten.

General workflow. Merge your branch to the master everyone is on
	#rebase your master so your branch shares the same historical starting point
	(master) $ git pull --rebase
	
	(master) $ git checkout mybranch

	(my_branch) $ git merge master

	(my_branch) $ git checkout master

	#You can't merge until the branch has the same starting point as what is the active master
	(my_branch) $ git merge mybranch
